# Timeline & Decision Gates

## Key Dates

| Date | Event | Action Required |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| **Feb 14 (today)** | Preflight created | ✅ Done |
| **Feb 22** | Go/No-Go decision | Check: registrations, ES sprint health, capacity |
| **Feb 23** | Hackathon opens | Start building (if GO) |
| **Feb 27** | Elasticsearch deadline | ES submission due — Lablab effort pauses if needed |
| **Mar 1** | Lablab deadline | Final submission due |

## Critical Constraint
**Elasticsearch ($20K) takes absolute priority over Lablab ($3.5K).**

- Feb 23-27: If ES sprint needs help, Lablab gets zero hours
- Feb 27-Mar 1: After ES submission, Lablab gets remaining capacity (up to 16h)
- The 4-day gap between ES deadline (Feb 27) and Lablab deadline (Mar 1) is the sweet spot

## Ideal Scenario
1. ES sprint completes on time (Feb 27)
2. Feb 27 evening – Mar 1: 3 full days for Lablab build
3. 16 hours spread across 3 days = very comfortable

## Worst Case
1. ES sprint runs late, consumes all capacity through Feb 28
2. Feb 28 – Mar 1: 2 days for Lablab build
3. Fall back to 8-hour minimum viable submission plan
